introduction: |
  This solution provides a comprehensive approach to monitoring water usage, helping users conserve water and reduce waste by detecting unintended water flow.
description: |
  The Running Faucet Detection solution provides a reference for detecting if a faucet is running, using Edge Impulse's machine learning capabilities. This app is designed to be deployed on Particle devices, such as the Photon 2, Boron, and M-SoM, and uses sensors to monitor and classify water flow patterns. By leveraging Edge Impulse, this solution can detect the unique acoustic or vibration signatures associated with a running faucet, enabling users to identify water usage and detect potential leaks.

  Key Features:
  - Utilizes Edge Impulse's machine learning platform to train a model for identifying running water sounds or vibrations.
  - Compatible with Particle devices, allowing seamless deployment and edge processing.
  - Ideal for applications in water conservation, leak detection, and smart home automation.
